# FastAPI Dockerized Application with Docker Compose

This secion provides a Dockerized FastAPI application using Docker Compose. It includes a `Dockerfile` for building the image, a `docker-compose.yml` file for managing the application, and instructions for running the containerized application.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed and running: [Get Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- Docker Compose installed and running: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Usage

### Building the Image

1. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2. Build the Docker image using Docker Compose:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```
    This command instructs Docker Compose to:
    - Build the image based on the `Dockerfile` in the current directory.
    - Run the container in detached mode.

### Running the Application

Once the image is built, start the container using:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
This will start the container in the background and run your FastAPI application.

Accessing the Application
By default, the docker-compose.yml file exposes port 8000 of the container to port 8000 on your host machine. Access the application via:

Local Access: http://localhost:8000
External Access (Port Forwarding): http://<your_machine_ip>:5000 (if configured for port forwarding)
Stopping the Application
To stop the container, use:
docker-compose down

Additional Notes
This is a basic example. Modify it based on your project requirements.
For development, consider using volumes to persist your application code and dependencies between container restarts.
Refer to the official Docker documentation for more advanced usage.
Customize the docker-compose.yml file for additional services (e.g., databases).
Understanding the Files
Dockerfile
This file defines the instructions for building the Docker image. It typically includes:

Base image (e.g., python:3.8-slim)
Working directory
Copying application code
Installing dependencies from requirements.txt
Exposing the port on which the application listens
Command to start the application (e.g., uvicorn)
docker-compose.yml
This file defines the services and configurations for Docker Compose. It typically includes:

Version specification
Service definition for your web application:
Build context (.)
Command to run the application
Port mapping (e.g., 8000:8000)
Customization
Environment Variables: Pass environment variables to your application by defining them in the docker-compose.yml file under the environment section for the service.
Start Command: Modify the command section in docker-compose.yml to adjust how your application starts.
Volumes: Add a volumes section to the service in docker-compose.yml to map a directory on your host machine to a directory inside the container for persistent storage.
